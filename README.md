# LibraryNotes
Allows a user to create .txt notes about books or any other media read. Also allows the user to edit former notes created with this program.

Meant as a sort of notes software specifically about books. Keeps notes organized by creating tags in the filename, and allows the user to search through old notes using these tags.
