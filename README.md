# LibraryNotes
Allows a user to create .txt notes about books or any other media witnessed. Also allows the user to edit former notes created with this program. Meant as a sort of notes software specifically about books. Keeps notes organized by creating tags in the filename, and allows the user to search through old notes using these tags.

IN ORDER TO USE THIS YOU MUST EDIT THE PROGRAM.CS FILE. CREATE A FOLDER TO USE (EX: IN MYDOCUMENTS MAKE BOOK REVIEWS) RIGHT CLICK PROPERTIES COPY THE FOLDER LOCATION, PASTE THE LOCATION IN BETWEEN THE QUOTES WHERE IT SAYS !!!PUT YOUR BOOKREVIEW FOLDER HERE!!!

IF YOU DO NOT ADD THE FOLDER PROPERLY THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT WORK

The ID is a special signifier so you can quickly identify files. For example your bookreviews folder might look like this:

#AA00000 America Is Not A New Rome Smil Book.txt
#AA00001 Four Hour Body Ferriss Book.txt

etc

Its really important to not use the same id tags. For example, if youve already used #AA00001, dont use it again. 

Also filenames cannot contain  \ / : * ? " < > |. I personally recommend using only the following format for ID's: [HASHTAG] [TWO UPPERCASE LETTERS] [A FIVE DIGIT NUMBER] eg #AA00000

The Filer when searching for old ID's will search whatever input you search for. I highly recommend only searching for specific texts at a time and editing them one at a time.
